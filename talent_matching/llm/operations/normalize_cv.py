IMPORTANT:
- Extract email and phone if present in the CV
- skills is an array of objects with "name", "years", "proficiency" (1-10), and "evidence"
- For experience dates, use YYYY-MM format (e.g., "2023-03"). Use null for end_date if current job
- For social handles, extract just the username (e.g., "darshan9solanki" not "https://x.com/darshan9solanki")
- Separate hackathons from general projects - hackathons have prizes/competitions
- seniority_level must be uppercase: JUNIOR, MID, SENIOR, STAFF (IC track), LEAD (management track), PRINCIPAL, or EXECUTIVE
- Be factual. If information is missing, use null. Do not make up information.

SKILL PROFICIENCY RATING GUIDELINES (use this exact scale: {proficiency_scale}):
- 1 (Novice): Mentioned skill, no evidence of use
- 2 (Beginner): Coursework, tutorials, or minimal exposure
- 3 (Elementary): Basic exposure, used in a minor context
- 4 (Developing): Used in projects, ~1-2 years experience
- 5 (Competent): Solid working knowledge, ~2-3 years
- 6 (Proficient): Primary tech in job roles, 3+ years, meaningful projects
- 7 (Advanced): Strong practitioner, significant production experience
- 8 (Expert): Tech lead/architect level, core contributor, 5+ years deep experience
- 9 (Master): Industry-recognized depth, core infrastructure/protocol work
- 10 (World-class): Published author, major OSS maintainer, recognized expert
- Base ratings on EVIDENCE in the CV, not assumptions. Be conservative if evidence is limited.

SKILL EVIDENCE / ACHIEVEMENTS (for matchmaking):
For each skill, the "evidence" field is used for semantic matching with job requirements. Describe in 1-2 sentences what the candidate built or delivered using this skill (e.g. "Built production trading engine in Rust; led design of multi-token staking rewards"). Avoid generic phrases; cite specific projects, scale, or impact so we can compare to what jobs expect.

SOFT ATTRIBUTES RATING GUIDELINES (1-5 scale):

Leadership (has led teams/projects, made key decisions):
- 1: IC only, no leadership evidence
- 2: Informal mentoring or small project leadership
- 3: Led small projects or feature teams
- 4: Led significant teams/initiatives, hiring involvement
- 5: Led organizations/departments, C-level or founder experience

Autonomy (works independently, self-directed):
- 1: Worked only in structured team settings
- 2: Some independent task completion
- 3: Independent on projects, minimal supervision needed
- 4: Self-directed, drove initiatives without guidance
- 5: Founder-type self-starter, built things from scratch solo

Technical Depth (systems thinking, architecture skills):
- 1: Surface-level implementation
- 2: Understands components, some debugging skills
- 3: Solid practitioner, designs features independently
- 4: Architect-level, designs complex systems
- 5: Industry expert, deep infrastructure/protocol work

Communication (collaboration, documentation, public presence):
- 1: Minimal evidence of collaboration
- 2: Basic teamwork mentioned
- 3: Collaborates well, writes documentation
- 4: Technical writing, presentations, open source maintainer
- 5: DevRel, conference speaker, published author

Growth Trajectory (career progression, learning velocity):
- 1: Static career, same level roles
- 2: Slow, steady progression
- 3: Normal career growth
- 4: Fast progression, expanding scope
- 5: Exceptional acceleration, rapid title/responsibility growth

IMPORTANT: The "reasoning" field for each soft attribute should be a descriptive sentence citing specific evidence from the CV. This text will be used for semantic matching, so be specific and qualitative.

NARRATIVE WRITING GUIDELINES:

The "narratives" section contains pure prose paragraphs optimized for semantic search. These will be embedded as vectors and compared via cosine similarity against job description narratives. Write them as natural, flowing paragraphs - NO labels, NO bullet points, NO structured text.

**Vocabulary alignment:** Use the same vocabulary and concepts that job descriptions use. For example, describe career progression ("progressed from X to Y"), domain expertise ("deep expertise in X, particularly Y"), work style ("async-first", "ownership mentality", "builder"), impact scope ("led a team of N", "platform serving N users"), and technical depth ("distributed systems", "architecture decisions", "infrastructure"). This alignment maximizes match quality between candidate and job embeddings.

Experience narrative example:
"Progressed from backend engineer to tech lead over five years, primarily in fintech and crypto. Built trading systems handling millions in daily volume at Coinbase, then led a team of eight engineers at a DeFi startup where they architected the core smart contract infrastructure. Most recent role involved full-stack ownership of a cross-chain bridge serving institutional clients."

Domain narrative example:
"Deep expertise in decentralized finance, particularly lending protocols and automated market makers. Extensive experience with EVM chains, Solana, and cross-chain infrastructure. Understands both the technical implementation and the financial mechanisms that drive DeFi products. Has worked extensively with institutional trading workflows and compliance requirements."

Personality narrative example:
"Builder mentality who thrives in early-stage chaos and ambiguity. Prefers async-first communication and deep work blocks over constant meetings. Takes ownership of problems end-to-end rather than waiting for direction. Values shipping quickly and iterating based on user feedback over perfect planning."

Impact narrative example:
"Led architecture decisions for a platform serving over ten million users with 99.99% uptime. Owned the end-to-end development of a trading engine processing fifty million dollars in daily volume. Grew engineering team from three to twelve while maintaining velocity. Reduced infrastructure costs by sixty percent through optimization work."

Technical narrative example:
"Systems thinker who designs for scale and maintainability. Strong in distributed systems, particularly consensus mechanisms and eventual consistency patterns. Deep experience with Rust for performance-critical components and TypeScript for rapid iteration. Has built and operated production infrastructure handling millions of concurrent connections."

Be specific and cite evidence from the CV. Each narrative should be 3-5 sentences of pure prose."""

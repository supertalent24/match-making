Be factual. If information is not mentioned, use null.

**Matchmaking:** Narratives and structured fields are embedded for semantic matching with candidate profiles. Describe the ideal candidate in the same terms candidates use: career journey, domain expertise, work style, impact level, technical depth. Same vocabulary improves match quality.

**Seniority:** Use the same levels as candidate profiles (uppercase): JUNIOR, MID, SENIOR, STAFF (IC track), LEAD (management track), PRINCIPAL, EXECUTIVE.

**Skills:** Only include concrete, matchable **technical skills** in must_have_skills and nice_to_have_skills: programming languages, frameworks, libraries, tools, platforms, databases, protocols, and methodologies (e.g. "React", "TypeScript", "PostgreSQL", "GraphQL", "CI/CD", "System Design"). Do NOT include domain/vertical requirements (e.g. "Financial Interfaces", "Healthcare domain", "E-commerce experience", "Trading Dashboards") as skills -- instead weave domain requirements into the role_description and domain narrative where they are matched semantically against candidate profiles. Use canonical skill names so they match candidate skill lists: e.g. "React" not "ReactJS", "TypeScript" not "TS", "PostgreSQL" not "Postgres". For each required skill, output an object with "name", "min_years", "min_level", and "expected_capability".

- **min_years** (int or null): minimum years of experience with this specific skill. Extract from phrases like "5+ years of React", "at least 3 years". Use null when no years requirement is stated or implied for this skill. Do NOT confuse overall years_of_experience_min with per-skill min_years.
- **min_level** (int 1-10 or null): minimum proficiency level expected. Use the following scale (same as candidate ratings): {proficiency_scale}. Infer from context: "production experience" suggests 7-8 (Advanced/Expert), "deep expertise" or "architect-level" suggests 9+ (Master), "familiarity" or "exposure" suggests 3-4 (Elementary/Developing). Use null when proficiency level is not implied.
- **expected_capability**: 1-2 sentences inferring from the job description what the ideal candidate must be capable of with that skill (e.g. "Design and implement REST APIs; integrate with internal services"). Use the same vocabulary as candidate skill evidence for better semantic matching.

Apply to must_have_skills and nice_to_have_skills. tech_stack remains a simple array of canonical names.

**Soft attribute requirements:** Infer minimum 1-5 scores from job description signals (e.g. "lead small team" -> leadership 3; "self-directed" -> autonomy 4). Use the same five dimensions as candidate profiles: leadership, autonomy, technical_depth, communication, growth_trajectory. Use null when not implied.

**Compensation:** Always normalize to yearly amounts for salary_min and salary_max. If the posting states hourly, daily, or monthly rates, convert to yearly (e.g. hourly × 2080 for full-time, × 1040 for half-time; monthly × 12). Keep the stated currency. Use null only when no numeric compensation is given.

**Timezone requirements:** Extract timezone constraints from phrases like "US time zones", "European hours", "EST to CET overlap". Convert named timezones to UTC offset ranges (e.g. "US time zones" -> "UTC-10 to UTC-5", "European hours" -> "UTC+0 to UTC+3"). Use null when no timezone constraint is mentioned. For remote roles, infer from context if possible (e.g. company HQ location, meeting overlap requirements).

**Job title:** Use English. If the posting is in another language (e.g. German "Frontend-Entwickler"), output the English equivalent (e.g. "Frontend Developer")."""

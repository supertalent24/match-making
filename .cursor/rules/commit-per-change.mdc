# Commit Per Change

After completing each distinct feature or fix, create a separate git commit immediately.

- One commit per feature or fix — do not batch unrelated changes together.
- Write a concise commit message that describes the "why", not just the "what".
- If a task involves multiple independent features or fixes, commit each one as soon as it is complete before moving on to the next.

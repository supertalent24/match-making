Most of my work has been around complex, data-heavy products like blockchain explorers, trading terminals, SDKs, and DeFi interfaces, where performance, reliability, and UX really matter.

I’ve worked across the stack using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and blockchain tooling. I’ve built real-time UIs using websockets, optimized frontend performance for high-traffic apps, and designed systems that scale across multiple chains.

One thing that sets me apart is my focus on simplifying complexity. I’ve worked on account and chain abstraction, trading flows, and developer tooling so users and users don’t need to think about the underlying blockchain details. I care deeply about clean architecture, readable code, and building products that feel reliable and intuitive, even when the underlying systems are complex.",1) https://routernitro.com/swap,"$91,000 - $125,000",https://x.com/mynk_s_rwt,,,https://github.com/mynk-s-rwt,"Mayank Rawat

Over the years, I’ve worked in different roles — as a CTO, co-founder, and tech lead — which helped me develop a strong sense of ownership and a holistic understanding of how products are built and scaled.

I fully cover the technical side of a project: from architecture and implementation to delivery and collaboration with product and business teams. I’m used to working in fast-moving environments, making decisions under uncertainty, and taking responsibility for results — not just writing code.

What I value most in my work is clarity, reliability, and strong collaboration. I care deeply about product quality, clean communication, and healthy team culture. I’m a highly responsible and empathetic person, and I genuinely enjoy working with people who care about what they build and how they build it.

I would be very excited to join a team that values craftsmanship, trust, and long-term thinking, and I’m looking forward to the opportunity to contribute and grow together.","1) https://swap.puzzle.network/trade

I studied business psychology and got into crypto through game theory and incentive design. These days I spend my time building products, playing poker, and probably too much chess.
 
Over the last two years I've gone from crypto analyst to building two companies on Solana. I founded SolRouter, a cryptographically private AI gateway where I built the full stack (React, Node.js, SQL, wallet auth, on-chain payments) and partnered with Arcium and Umbra on MPC encryption and secure data flows. I integrated multiple LLM APIs, built intelligent routing systems, fine-tuned models, and created AI agents that work with on-chain data.

Before that, I co-founded Degen Markets and raised $250K in pre-seed funding while managing product development and forging partnerships with Dialect, SagaDAO, and other Solana ecosystem projects. Earlier, I worked at LHP as a crypto analyst doing on-chain data analysis and investment research. 

Looking for a role where I can contribute across different functions. I'm comfortable with ambiguity and work best in fast-paced environments where shipping and execution are what matter.

My background spans startups, scale-ups, and global enterprises, with proven success in technical strategy, architecture modernization, team leadership, and hands-on engineering across backend, frontend, DevOps, and blockchain domains. 


What sets me apart is my ability to rapidly audit, understand, and restructure highly entangled systems—technically, organizationally, and operationally. I specialize in rescuing critical projects, defining target architectures, and building high-performing engineering cultures. I have repeatedly led major transformations: monolith-to-microservices migrations, cloud modernization (AWS/Azure/GCP), DevOps revamps, and large-scale API-first redesigns. 


As a technologist, I’m deeply hands-on: from Rust, Go, Java, microservices, scalable distributed systems, Kubernetes, and cloud infrastructure to blockchain protocols, Solana programs, and Solidity smart contracts. I’ve delivered security-critical products, architected confidential trading protocols, and built complete SaaS platforms end-to-end. My work has been recognized through national awards, international hackathons, and successful product launches. 


I’m most proud of my ability to combine strategic vision with execution: aligning technology with business, coaching engineering teams, introducing governance and processes, and driving organizations toward measurable, sustainable technical excellence.

I’ve spent the last two year experimenting, breaking things, and rebuilding them until they run clean. Most of my work happens privately, not because I’m hiding it, but because I push a lot of in-progress systems tied to live trading and automation.

What drives me is curiosity and problem-solving. I’ve built everything from transaction debuggers and token distributors to arbitrage engines and flash loan bots. A few examples: ARGUS (a Solana transaction debugger that explains failed transactions like a human would), Bounty Beacon (Merkle-based token distributor for community payouts), and Sweeper-UI (a clean way to close token accounts and reclaim rent).

I’m part engineer, part explorer, constantly testing new APIs, writing async systems, and helping devs onboard faster into the Jupiter and Solana ecosystems. I like translating hard technical problems into things people can actually use.

What makes me stand out isn’t just code, it’s consistency. I show up every day, I build, I learn, and I improve. I laser focus on solving problems that matter. I’m here to push the Solana ecosystem forward, I see it as my home and would love to join a team that is like minded and shares the same goals/ambition.

Over the past two years, I’ve contributed to the Solana and broader Web3 ecosystem as a builder, researcher, and Head of Operations, where I managed business development, tokenomics, and client relations.

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge technical development with product, research, and community growth. I’ve built DeFi tools, experimented with stablecoin-based fee abstraction, and conducted research on Solana improvement proposals (SIMDs) around validator performance, rent rewrites, and slashing mechanisms. At the same time, I’ve led operations for startups and organized large-scale blockchain events, giving me a well-rounded perspective on both building and scaling Web3 projects.

I’m proud of combining this cross-functional experience to bring fresh, creative ideas and a forward-looking perspective to every team I work with.

I am Alex, and I have a data science and bioinformatics background from my bachelor’s degree, and am currently studying information systems for my master’s. I have over five years of experience in IT consulting and software development, mainly in development and DevOps roles. I got involved in Web3 in 2021 with all the hype around crypto and joined the TUM Blockchain Club in late 2022. I became head of the IT department, joined the board, and now serve on the advisory board. I help organize the TUM Blockchain Conference, Europe’s largest student-led blockchain conference, where I lead the sponsor team, manage the regulation track, and head the DAO delegations team. Currently, I am working as a freelancer on developing an AI agent for DAOs.

I have been in Web3 development since 2022, when I started to attend hackathons such as ETHGlobal, Colosseum, and Sui Basecamp. I know smart contracts development as well as full-stack development.

Currently, I am interested in analytics roles where I can leverage my data science background with my general interest in finance and crypto.","https://invofi.xyz/, https://conference.tum-blockchain.com/, https://donnut.vercel.app/,  https://github.com/benbencik/verifiable-benchmarks, ",50-70k,https://x.com/tsatscha,https://www.linkedin.com/in/semenov-alex/,,https://github.com/Tsatsch,"Alexander Semenov

I’ve built full products from scratch — including Web3 wallets with messaging, multi-DEX swappers (with Rust routing logic), NFT-based games, and crypto e-commerce platforms.

I work across Solidity, Python (FastAPI), Rust, and TypeScript (React/Angular). My strength is owning the full stack: smart contracts, backend APIs, scalable architectures, and UX.

What makes me stand out is my ability to design entire systems that are both technically solid and product-driven. I’m not just an implementer — I bring structure, vision, and clean code.

One thing I’m proud of: building a crypto swapper that scans multiple DEXs, optimizes routing in real-time using a Rust engine I wrote from scratch, and connects to the frontend with a clean API.

I'm based in France and work 100% remote, already validated on multiple complex projects.",,500€/day,https://x.com/no twitter,https://www.linkedin.com/in/romain-creuzenet-0b5a5b225/,,https://github.com/Romain331,"ROMAIN CREUZENET

Backend Project lead @ LI.FI - 02/2024 – 05/2025: Remote
Expanding LI.FI’s existing DeFi-aggregation product to the Solana blockchain:
Joining LI.FI as an independent freelancer, I led the Solana expansion project within their backend team, making
Solana DEXes and bridges available to LI.FI’s DeFi-aggregation products such as jumper.exchange . This included
writing a Solana program in Rust for tracking blockchain transactions, building a scalable indexing/parsing
system as well as integrating with and refactoring their existing typescript/nodejs-based backend code.
Project tech lead @ Staking Facilities - 08/2020 – 04/2023: Munich, Germany & New York City, USA
SolanaBeach - Leading a team of 5 developers on a block-explorer project for the Solana Blockchain:
At StakingFacilities, a blockchain node operator specialized in proof-of-stake blockchains, I discovered the
consensus mechanisms and decentralized execution tech behind proof-of-stake blockchains such as Solana.
After building various in-house web- and accounting-software for StakingFacilities, I eventually took charge of
developing their block explorer project solanabeach.io. I hired and led a team of 5 developers to work on a highthroughput
data processing and API backend, written in Rust. This involved streaming, storing and aggregating
terabytes of Solana blockchain data using technologies such as Apache Kafka, Redpanda, and GCP bigtable.

At the augmented reality startup Viscopic (now a part of TeamViewer), I developed AR-software for industrial
use cases using Hololens 1 and 2 AR-glasses, for customers such as Tetrapak, Porsche and Volkswagen. We were
one of the few Microsoft Partners worldwide to get early access to Hololens 2 development devices, and among
the first to use the Unity3D mixed reality toolkit SDK. My work involved testing and iterating on"

I specialise in Web3 growth, performance marketing and ecosystem development, converging data-driven acquisition strategies with community-driven adoption. I’ve run and optimised paid campaigns across Google, Meta, and Twitter, onboarding thousands of users to DeFi platforms and developer tools while ensuring real retention. One of my biggest wins was launching a Google + Meta Ads strategy for a DeFi project, increasing liquidity provider sign-ups by 40% while lowering acquisition costs by 28%. 
For a Web3 infrastructure provider, I scaled developer adoption through Twitter Ads and incentive-driven onboarding, leading to a 3x increase in subgraph deployments. My strength is bridging performance marketing with on-chain analytics.

Passionate about the rise of blockchain technology, I decided to deep dive into the field and enrolled in developer courses, starting with full-stack JavaScript and later specializing in Solidity development through Alyra.

Since completing my training, I have continuously worked on building EVM-based dApps. 
Since summer 2024, I have been involved in the Solana France community. I see in Solana a user-friendly experience that has the potential to support mass-market use cases.

Over the past year, I have been involved in four different projects :

- beFUNDR - a secure community funding platform dedicated to OG communities on solana (under development)
- cryptobottle.fr - NFT Collection Creation Platform: Crypto Bottle allows individuals and companies to create NFT collections containing cryptocurrency. I was responsible for full-stack Web2 development.
- fcshiba.com - The First Web3 Football Club: I am in charge of the entire development process, including frontend, backend, and smart contracts.
- rogalagallery.art - Art Gallery and NFT Minting Platform: i'm in charge of all aspects of development, from frontend and backend to authentication and smart contract development and implementation.

 - 350k+ on-chain subscribers
 - $100K+ monthly revenue streams for top creators
 - I contributed with delivery of multiple features, in-app transaction flows, wallet connect, token swap interfaces, building smart contracst, helping scale the backend to demands of thousands of users and creators with large follower bases

- Access Creator Coin Launchpad - a Solana token launchpad
 - https://launch.accessprotocol.co/
 - Custom launch criteria - creator coin launches when proof-of-audience is met on-chain
 - Built with Raydium AMM solution, later migrated to Meteora
 - I contributed by leading design and implementation of the backend and supporting services development

- Access Intelligence
 - https://launch.accessprotocol.co/marketplace
 - AI agent marketplace - agents capable of doing market research and social media posting
 - I built RAG pipelines that enable agents to connect to external datasources for real-time market data
 - Built payment flows using Solana Pay to purchase agent data sources
 - Implemented infrastructure to self-host AI agents, including automated deployment pipelines, resource usage monitoring, and dynamic provisioning of new VPS instances when capacity was reached

Parting ways with Access Protocol on excellent terms and the CEO of Access, Andreas Nicolos (@AndreasNicolos on TG), will be happy to recommend me for any future roles.

I am passionate about Solana and currently participating in the privacy hackathon.

Ready to start with new work very soon, in February. Looking for senior positions in ambitious projects.


Best regards,
Sal

C++ (performance/lock-free) first, also ship production systems in Rust/Go/Python, and I’m strong at taking research → robust code with institutional reliability. 
I’ve also built (of course!) crypto projects (e.g., multisig payment demonstrators, crypto/DeFi infrastructure prototypes, post-quantum/security work, ZK-based database architecture proof of concept, ...). 
Currently building privacy-first ML/quant infrastructure at Anzaetek; proudest of repeatedly shipping complex systems from a clean slate to “works every day” quality. 
Internal infra is being progressively migrated towards decentralized systems.

My experience spans from modifying the bottom layers of Geth—including transaction processing, EVM state management, and key-value databases—to building high-availability backend systems for applications with over 1.1 million DAU.

What defines my approach is a commitment to algorithmic efficiency. While developing a State Expiry protocol, I designed a recovery mechanism that was significantly more optimized than the initial proposal, leading to its adoption as a core feature of the protocol. This experience gave me a profound understanding of how data persistence and state transitions impact chain performance.

While my technical roots are deep in the EVM ecosystem, I pride myself on being a results-oriented engineer who can deliver value in any environment. This was recently demonstrated at the 2025 Sonic Mobius Hackathon, where I joined as a backend developer. Despite being relatively new to the Solana/SVM landscape at the time, I successfully built the necessary infrastructure to support our project, ultimately helping our team secure 1st place in the Gaming Track. I bridge the gap between low-level protocol constraints and user-facing application needs, ensuring that even the most complex decentralized systems remain stable and scalable.","1) https://github.com/overprotocol/kairos/tree/ethanos

Synto (CTO): AI-agent for Web3 that won 1st place at Paris Blockchain Week 2025, automating DeFi operations via Jupiter/Meteora using Pinocchio and ElizaOS

What makes me stand out:

I'm not just a programs developer. I build the entire stack: from native Solana programs in Rust to the backend infrastructure (Go, TypeScript), databases (PostgreSQL, Redis), and deployment (Kubernetes, GitOps, Falco security monitoring). When I ship something, it's production-ready with monitoring, security, and scalability baked in.

What I'm most proud of:

Winning Paris Blockchain Week 2025 with Synto validated years of deep work on Solana. But honestly, I'm more proud of Watchoor hitting 20k monthly users as a solo project. Building something people actually use, end-to-end, from smart contracts to infrastructure, is what I love doing.

Additionally, I've spent some time helping the France SuperTeam after a track prize won at Colosseum breakpoint. Doing some mentoring for projects for the latest Colosseum particularly.","1) https://watchoor.xyz/

My work sits at the intersection of on-chain protocol design, high-throughput backend services, and execution-focused product tooling.
Currently at Keel.fi, I design and ship Rust (Anchor)–based Solana programs that manage borrowing, lending, collateral, and automated rebalancing across multiple DeFi protocols. I also architect the backend microservices and data pipelines (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis, GraphQL) that power real-time risk calculations, position tracking, and execution automation. One of my proudest contributions is building systems that reliably coordinate on-chain execution with off-chain strategy engines under real-world market conditions.
Previously, I led development of Astralane, a Solana indexing and infrastructure platform processing 500K+ daily transactions, where I built low-latency indexers, analytics pipelines, and execution services used for trading, arbitrage, and DeFi strategies. This gave me deep exposure to Solana internals, protocol behavior, and performance-critical data systems at scale.
What sets me apart is my ability to own complex systems end-to-end — from Rust-based smart contracts and backend microservices to trading terminals and user-facing dashboards — while keeping a strong focus on correctness, performance, and long-term maintainability. I’m most excited by early-stage teams building serious financial infrastructure, where engineering quality and execution discipline matter more than hype.","1) https://keel.fi/

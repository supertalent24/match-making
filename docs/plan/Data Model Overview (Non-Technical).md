## 6. Soft Attributes

These are **universal qualities** that matter for any job. The AI scores each candidate 1-5:

| Attribute | What It Measures | Signals in CV |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Leadership** | Has led teams or projects | "Led team of 10", "Architected", "Managed" |
| **Autonomy** | Works independently | Founder roles, solo projects, remote success |
| **Technical Depth** | Systems thinking, handles complexity | Infrastructure, performance optimization |
| **Communication** | Collaboration, writing, speaking | Documentation, blog posts, talks |
| **Growth Trajectory** | Career progression speed | Promotions, expanding scope |

### Score Meanings

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Minimal | Little evidence of this quality |
| 2 | Basic | Some indicators present |
| 3 | Solid | Clear evidence, meets expectations |
| 4 | Strong | Above average, stands out |
| 5 | Exceptional | Top-tier, very impressive |

### Example: Candidate's Soft Attributes

| Attribute | Score | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Leadership | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4) | Led frontend architecture decisions, mentored developers |
| Autonomy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4) | Built complex multi-chain systems independently |
| Technical Depth | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5) | Deep expertise in real-time systems, cross-chain architecture |
| Communication | ⭐⭐⭐ (3) | Good documentation, but limited public speaking |
| Growth Trajectory | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4) | Quick progression to Senior, expanded into new domains |

## 7. Job Requirements

### Basic Job Info

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Title** | Job title | "Senior Frontend Engineer" |
| **Company** | Hiring company | "Trojan Trading" |
| **Seniority Level** | Required level | Senior |
| **Employment Type** | Full-time, part-time, contract | Full-time |
| **Location** | Remote, hybrid, onsite | Remote |
| **Salary Range** | Compensation offered | $100,000 - $350,000 |

### Skill Requirements

| Category | Skills | How We Use It |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Must-Have** | React, Next.js, TypeScript, WebSocket | Candidate must have these (filter) |
| **Nice-to-Have** | Solana, DeFi, CI/CD | Bonus points if they have these |
| **Domain Experience** | Trading Platforms, DeFi, Crypto | Match against candidate's past work |

### Soft Attribute Minimums

Jobs can specify minimum scores for soft attributes:

| Attribute | Minimum Required | Why (from job description) |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Leadership | 4+ | "key decision maker on frontend team" |
| Autonomy | 4+ | "highly autonomous and driven" |
| Technical Depth | 4+ | "complex challenges", "optimize for speed" |
| Communication | 3+ | "articulate ideas and collaborate" |
| Growth | — | Not specified |

### Enriching Jobs After Discovery Calls

After a discovery call with the client, the team can **directly edit** the normalized job fields to incorporate additional insights:

| What to Update | Example Change |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Must-Have Skills** | Add "HFT experience" if client emphasized it |
| **Nice-to-Have Skills** | Add specific technologies mentioned |
| **Domain Experience** | Add "Trading Platforms" or specific company backgrounds |
| **Soft Attribute Minimums** | Increase leadership score if they need someone senior |

This keeps the data model simple while allowing full flexibility to refine requirements.

## 8. Semantic Vectors (AI Matching)

Beyond exact filters and scores, we use **AI-generated vectors** to find candidates who are *semantically similar* to what the job needs — even if the exact words don't match.

### What Are Vectors?

A vector is a way to represent text as numbers that capture its **meaning**. Two pieces of text with similar meaning will have similar vectors, even if they use different words.

**Example:**
- "Built a DEX on Solana" and "Developed decentralized exchange for Solana blockchain" → **Very similar vectors**
- "Built a DEX on Solana" and "Managed marketing campaigns" → **Very different vectors**

### Candidate Vectors

We generate these vectors for each candidate:

| Vector | What It Captures | Question It Answers |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Experience Vector** | Overall career story (all roles combined) | "Who has a similar overall background?" |
| **Domain Context Vector** | Industries & problem spaces worked in | "Who has worked in DeFi vs NFTs vs Infrastructure?" |
| **Personality Vector** | Work style, values, culture fit | "Who would thrive in a fast-paced startup?" |
| **Position Vectors** | Each individual past role (one per job) | "Who has done *this exact job* before?" |
| **Skill Vectors** | Notable achievements per skill | "Who has deep TypeScript expertise in trading?" |

### Job Vectors

We generate these vectors for each job:

| Vector | What It Captures | Matches Against |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Role Description Vector** | What the job involves | Candidate's position vectors |
| **Domain Context Vector** | Product/industry context | Candidate's domain vector |
| **Culture Vector** | Team style, work environment | Candidate's personality vector |

### How Vector Matching Works

```
Job: "Senior Frontend Engineer at crypto trading platform"
                    ↓
        [Generate job vectors]
                    ↓
    Compare against all candidate vectors
                    ↓
    "Who has worked on something similar?"
                    ↓
    Candidates ranked by similarity (0-100%)
```

### Why This Matters

| Scenario | Exact Matching | Vector Matching |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Job says "DEX experience" | Only finds "DEX" in CV | Also finds "decentralized exchange", "AMM", "liquidity pool" |
| Job says "trading platform" | Only finds "trading platform" | Also finds "exchange", "order book", "market maker" |
| Job is at a "lean startup" | Can't filter for this | Finds candidates who worked at similar-stage companies |

Vectors let us find the **right** candidates, not just the ones who used the exact same words.

## 9. How Matching Works

When a job comes in, we find the best candidates in **three steps**:

### Step 1: Hard Filters (Eliminate Non-Starters)

These are deal-breakers. Candidates who don't meet these are excluded:

| Filter | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Years of experience | Must have 5+ years |
| Required skills | Must have React, TypeScript |
| Seniority level | Must be Senior or above |
| Verification | Not marked as fraudulent |

**Result:** Narrows thousands → hundreds of candidates

### Step 2: Score-Based Ranking

For remaining candidates, we calculate scores:

| Score Type | Weight | What It Measures |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| **Skill Match** | 40% | Do they have the required skills at the right level? |
| **Similarity Match** | 60% | How similar is their experience to what the job needs? |

**Skill Match Example:**
- Job needs: React (must-have), Solana (nice-to-have)
- Candidate has: React ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, Solana ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Score: Very high!

**Similarity Match:**
- We use AI to compare the job description against the candidate's past roles
- "Has this person done similar work before?"

### Step 3: Soft Attribute Filtering

If the job requires minimum soft scores, we filter:

| Job Requires | Candidate Has | Pass? |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Leadership ≥ 4 | Leadership = 4 | ✅ Yes |
| Autonomy ≥ 4 | Autonomy = 4 | ✅ Yes |
| Technical ≥ 4 | Technical = 5 | ✅ Yes |
| Communication ≥ 3 | Communication = 3 | ✅ Yes |

### Final Result

Top 20-50 candidates ranked by match score, with breakdown showing:
- ✅ Which skills they have
- ✅ How their experience matches
- ✅ Their soft attribute scores
- ⚠️ Any gaps to be aware of
